# Gamified discussion with restrictions

The name of this method is yet to be defined. But I hope that the goal can be gleaned from this short description.

The purpose of this method is to help each participant to be aware both of themselves and others. With this method, each participant would hopefully learn to appreciate more the role of a facilitator in a discussion, the value of making your words concise so as to not monopolize the discussion and lastly, see the value in listening to other participants point of view in order to achieve the best amount of productivity.

In this type of discussion there are 4 kinds of participants :

- The facilitator
- The speaker
- The listener
- The reporter (Bonus character)

## The facilitator

The facilitator's job is to make sure every person who wants to contribute are allotted a fair amount of time while considering the time limit of the entire meeting. The facilitator is not allowed to talk, and will keep an eye of the listeners who want to contribute their ideas. Once they feel like it's time for the next contributor, they tap on the shoulder of the speaker, and thus notifying them that it's time for the next person. One thing to keep in mind, is that no participant is allowed to talk until at least two people have been allowed to be the speaker after them.

## The speaker

The speaker is the person currently explaining the ideas behind their thoughts, and is the only person allowed to talk. For them to better appreciate the value of concise phrases, they will always close their eyes while speaking and will have no prior warning of when to stop talking, since they cannot see the audience nor can they know that the facilitator is about to stop them, until it's done. Once the facilitator taps on their shoulder, they should stop right away.

## The listener

The listener is the audience to the speaker, and at the same time a potential candidate to step on the stage and shine brilliantly! They are not allowed to talk, and so have to raise their hand whenever they feel the need to contribute, even if they were the last person to talk before the current speaker. It's the facilitator's job to facilitate.

## The reporter (Bonus character)

Anyone but the speaker can be a reporter. Their role is to try and summarize on paper what the speaker was talking about in 20 words or less. Once the speaker has stopped blabbering, the writing is shown to them and they rate out of 5 the accuracy of what was written. That score is then copied on the paper. After the facilitator has chosen the next speaker, the reporter passed the pen and paper to whomever they want to choose as the next reporter.
